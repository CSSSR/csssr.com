    "typescript": "We&nbsp;also use <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">TypeScript</span> and <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Flow</span> to&nbsp;add static typing support in&nbsp;JS. This helps&nbsp;us to&nbsp;write flexible and reliable code."

But React can be&nbsp;well applied to&nbsp;small projects, including landing pages.",
    "angular": "is&nbsp;a&nbsp;framework that provides a&nbsp;large number of&nbsp;ready-made solutions to&nbsp;standard problems. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;best suited for typical projects where a&nbsp;serious customization of&nbsp;the application architecture is&nbsp;not required.",
    "vue": "is&nbsp;a&nbsp;library that is&nbsp;very similar to&nbsp;React in&nbsp;its ideology, but close to&nbsp;Angular in&nbsp;syntax. It&nbsp;has difficulties with TypeScript and FlowType support, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;don&rsquo;t use it&nbsp;very often."
