At&nbsp;such a&nbsp;pace, there was simply no&nbsp;room for experiments or&nbsp;organization of&nbsp;our own front-end development process. We&nbsp;needed a&nbsp;timely result with guaranteed quality. That&rsquo;s why we&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t think for a&nbsp;long time: we&nbsp;came to&nbsp;CSSSR as&nbsp;we&nbsp;repeatedly crossed paths with the guys&rsquo; work for the projects of&nbsp;our clients and understood very well what output we&nbsp;will get. It&rsquo;s cool that all our expectations of&nbsp;the result were fully met. Moreover, the CSSSR framework allowed&nbsp;us to&nbsp;further develop the project on&nbsp;our own (though at&nbsp;a&nbsp;much slower pace). Investments in&nbsp;a&nbsp;stormy start with CSSSR still justify themselves up&nbsp;to&nbsp;now.",
