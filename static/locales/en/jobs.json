    "description": "The recruitment process at&nbsp;CSSSR consists of&nbsp;several stages. Typically you’ll complete a&nbsp;test task, and have an&nbsp;interview with our recruitment team. Then you’ll get the opportunity to&nbsp;impress&nbsp;us in&nbsp;a&nbsp;technical interview and show that you can get along with your potential future boss. The entire process can take a&nbsp;few weeks, and, as&nbsp;our experience has taught&nbsp;us, the results are worth&nbsp;it."

    "descriptionFirst": "Being a&nbsp;successful company in&nbsp;the 21st century doesn’t mean sitting face-to-face in&nbsp;an&nbsp;office. The majority of&nbsp;CSSSR employees work wherever they see fit: at&nbsp;home, in&nbsp;coffee shops, traffic jams, at&nbsp;the airport, on&nbsp;a&nbsp;beach in&nbsp;the Indian Ocean, or&nbsp;even from outside of&nbsp;our solar system (as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;there’s an&nbsp;internet connection).",
    "descriptionSecond": "But not having to&nbsp;commute to&nbsp;an&nbsp;office doesn’t mean less responsibility or&nbsp;more free time. The first requirement for remote work is&nbsp;the ability to&nbsp;organize your time and to&nbsp;work full-time, without excuses."
