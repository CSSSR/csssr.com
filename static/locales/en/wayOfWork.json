    "description": "We&nbsp;provide clients with well organized development teams. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule, teams include 2-5 front-end developers, including a&nbsp;team leader, 1-2&nbsp;QA engineers and a&nbsp;project manager.",
    "firstParagraph": "When required, we&nbsp;can also assemble a&nbsp;team including back-end developers and systems analysts. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;provide lean and efficient results, we&nbsp;sometimes divide functionality and employ several teams on&nbsp;larger projects.",
    "secondParagraph":"From the client side, the team is&nbsp;usually joined by&nbsp;a&nbsp;product manager, designer and sometimes others. This can cause the lines between processes and teams to&nbsp;blur.",
