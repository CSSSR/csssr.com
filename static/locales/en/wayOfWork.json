    "firstParagraph": "When required, we&nbsp;can also assemble a&nbsp;team including back-end developers and systems analysts. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;provide lean and efficient results, we&nbsp;sometimes divide functionality and employ several teams on&nbsp;larger projects.",
    "secondParagraph":"From the client side, the team is&nbsp;usually joined by&nbsp;a&nbsp;product manager, designer and sometimes others. This can cause the lines between processes and teams to&nbsp;blur.",

      "text_2": "In&nbsp;a&nbsp;classic scrum, at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sprint a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;functionality is&nbsp;rolled out for production. Our weekly sprints, on&nbsp;the other hand, are fixed agreements on&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain amount of&nbsp;work that must be&nbsp;completed within a&nbsp;given timeframe. For example, we&nbsp;may complete some features, but testing could be&nbsp;scheduled and completed in&nbsp;the next sprint."

      "text": "For example, each pull request must be&nbsp;approved by&nbsp;at&nbsp;least two developers. Only after approval can the code be&nbsp;put into a&nbsp;stable branch. In&nbsp;code review, we&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;business logic, code readability, architecture and APIs."
