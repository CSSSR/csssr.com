          We&nbsp;use cookies that are essential to&nbsp;making the Sites work. These types
          of&nbsp;cookies enable you to&nbsp;move around the Sites and use their features. For
          example, we&nbsp;may use cookies to&nbsp;manage user sessions, or&nbsp;adjust settings and

        </p>
        <h4 className="cookie-h4 font_h3-regular">Preference Cookies</h4>
        <p className="font_p16-regular text">
          We&nbsp;also use cookies that collect information about your choices and preferences.
          These cookies allow&nbsp;us to&nbsp;remember language or&nbsp;other local settings and
          customize the Sites accordingly. For example, we&nbsp;may store settings and preferences
          of&nbsp;our users.
        </p>
        <h4 className="cookie-h4 font_h3-regular">Social Media Cookies</h4>
        <p className="font_p16-regular text">
          Some of&nbsp;the pages on&nbsp;the Sites contain tools or&nbsp;applications that are
          linked to&nbsp;third-party social media service providers such as&nbsp;Facebook, Twitter
          and LinkedIn. The social media service provider may set its own cookies on&nbsp;your
          computer or&nbsp;device through these tools or&nbsp;applications. You should check the
          social media service provider&rsquo;s website for further details about how they use
          cookies.

        <h4 className="cookie-h4 font_h3-regular">Analytics Cookies</h4>
        <p className="font_p16-regular text">
          These cookies collect information about how people are using the Sites, for example which
          pages are visited the most often, how visitors move from one webpage to&nbsp;another, and
          whether visitors experience any difficulties using the Sites. Overall, these cookies
          provide&nbsp;us with analytical information about how the Sites are performing and how
          we&nbsp;can improve&nbsp;it, and in&nbsp;some instances, whether our advertising

          websites over time. These third parties may set and access cookies on&nbsp;your computer
          or&nbsp;other device and may also use web logs, pixel tags, or&nbsp;web beacons. These
          cookies are used to&nbsp;deliver advertisements that are more relevant to&nbsp;you and
          your interests. They are also used to&nbsp;limit the number of&nbsp;times you see
